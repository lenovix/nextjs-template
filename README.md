This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## WebView

The WebView feature is in active development. Workarounds:

- Use ResizeObserver to detect changes in the height of the object element, but please note that it currently only works in Firefox due to a known bug (https://bug.com).

- Use fetch to check the availability of the site, but be aware that it may not work on sites with the 'X-Frame-Options' header.

Here are some sites that work and some that do not work.

| work                                                          | not work             |
